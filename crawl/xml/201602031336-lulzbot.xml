LulzBot 3D printers use parts printed with ABS. Therefore we rely not only on our machines to print reliably to make more of them, we also need the ABS parts themselves to last under heavy use. With our cluster of over 145 LulzBot 3D printers being used nearly every day, suffice to say ABS has passed the test. ABS prints can be sanded or smoothed using an advanced technique with acetone. Experienced users have found that the visible layers on a print can be significantly reduced with an acetone vapor bath (a process in which the ABS print is exposed to warm acetone vapor for a brief period of time). With this technique, you can have ABS parts that are glossy and smooth. This process may also strengthen the parts themselves by binding the printed layers together.                   </description><seller>Lulzbot</seller><sellerWeb>Lulzbot.com</sellerWeb></product><product id="2"><materialType>ABS</materialType><brand>ABS</brand><producer>Village Plastics</producer><price>42.95 </price><priceUnit>USD</priceUnit><diameter>3</diameter><diameterUnit>mm</diameterUnit><color>Blue</color><colorImgUrl>https://www.lulzbot.com/filament-color-image/893/86</colorImgUrl><weight>1</weight><packForm>reel</packForm><weightInKg>1</weightInKg><imageUrl>https://www.lulzbot.com/sites/default/files/styles/product_teaser/public/ABS_Group_4%3A3_v3.jpg?itok=urt8INKm</imageUrl><url>https://www.lulzbot.com/store/filament/abs</url><description>                     How sturdy is ABS?

Experienced users have found that the visible layers on a print can be significantly reduced with an acetone vapor bath (a process in which the ABS print is exposed to warm acetone vapor for a brief period of time). With this technique, you can have ABS parts that are glossy and smooth. This process may also strengthen the parts themselves by binding the printed layers together.                   </description><seller>Lulzbot</seller><sellerWeb>Lulzbot.com</sellerWeb></product><product id="20"><materialType>ABS,5lbReel</materialType><brand>ABS,5lbReel</brand><producer>Village Plastics</producer><price>95.00 </price><priceUnit>USD</priceUnit><diameter>3</diameter><diameterUnit>mm</diameterUnit><color>LulzBot Green</color><colorImgUrl>https://www.lulzbot.com/filament-color-image/1463/77</colorImgUrl><weight>5</weight><packForm>reel</packForm><weightInKg>2.25</weightInKg><imageUrl>https://www.lulzbot.com/sites/default/files/styles/product_teaser/public/5-pound_ABS_group.jpg?itok=5hFqzFQe</imageUrl><url>https://www.lulzbot.com/store/filament/abs-5lb-reel</url><description>                     How sturdy is ABS?

When 3D printed, it has a tensile strength of 8,500 PSI, making Alloy 910 almost as strong as Polycarbonate but easier to 3D print since it warps five times less. Perfect for applications where high strength and stiffness is key. Use Alloy 910 for frames or enclosures subject to stress and high impact, and items subject to repeated flexing such as buckles and clasps. Like other nylons, Alloy 910 has a large chemical resistance range and can even be dyed to achieve custom color profiles using Rit® brand dye.                   </description><seller>Lulzbot</seller><sellerWeb>Lulzbot.com</sellerWeb></product><product id="27"><materialType>bambooFill</materialType><brand>bambooFill</brand><producer>colorFabb</producer><price>65.00 </price><priceUnit>USD</priceUnit><diameter>2.85</diameter><diameterUnit>mm</diameterUnit><color>null</color><colorImgUrl>null</colorImgUrl><weight>600</weight><packForm>reel</packForm><weightInKg>0.6</weightInKg><imageUrl>https://www.lulzbot.com/sites/default/files/styles/product_teaser/public/bamboofill_spool.JPG?itok=R7hLtMz9</imageUrl><url>https://www.lulzbot.com/store/filament/bamboofill</url><description>                     bambooFill contains 20% recycled bamboo fibers mixed with 80% premium colorFabb PLA, so it prints well with minimal warping.
