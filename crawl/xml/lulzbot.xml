        <description>                     How sturdy is ABS? LulzBot 3D printers use parts printed with ABS. Therefore we rely not only on our machines to print reliably to make more of them, we also need the ABS parts themselves to last under heavy use. With our cluster of over 145 LulzBot 3D printers being used nearly every day, suffice to say ABS has passed the test. ABS prints can be sanded or smoothed using an advanced technique with acetone. Experienced users have found that the visible layers on a print can be significantly reduced with an acetone vapor bath (a process in which the ABS print is exposed to warm acetone vapor for a brief period of time). With this technique, you can have ABS parts that are glossy and smooth. This process may also strengthen the parts themselves by binding the printed layers together.                   </description>

        <description>                     How sturdy is ABS? LulzBot 3D printers use parts printed with ABS. Therefore we rely not only on our machines to print reliably to make more of them, we also need the ABS parts themselves to last under heavy use. With our cluster of over 145 LulzBot 3D printers being used nearly every day, suffice to say ABS has passed the test. ABS prints can be sanded or smoothed using an advanced technique with acetone. Experienced users have found that the visible layers on a print can be significantly reduced with an acetone vapor bath (a process in which the ABS print is exposed to warm acetone vapor for a brief period of time). With this technique, you can have ABS parts that are glossy and smooth. This process may also strengthen the parts themselves by binding the printed layers together.                   </description>

When 3D printed, it has a tensile strength of 8,500 PSI, making Alloy 910 almost as strong as Polycarbonate but easier to 3D print since it warps five times less. Perfect for applications where high strength and stiffness is key. Use Alloy 910 for frames or enclosures subject to stress and high impact, and items subject to repeated flexing such as buckles and clasps. Like other nylons, Alloy 910 has a large chemical resistance range and can even be dyed to achieve custom color profiles using Rit® brand dye.                   </description>

        <description>                     Since Bridge prints cleanly and easily you can print complex models that are ready to be used. The combination of strength, reduced shrinkage, and ease in printing allows you to go from 3D model to 3D printed part ready to be installed. Bridge Nylon filament adheres well to the bed when treated with a PVA glue solution (water &amp; PVA(Polyvinyl Acetate) glue) or a PVA glue stick. Bridge Nylon warps less than Nylon 618, 645 but slightly more than ABS, and prints well at 235°C. Like other Taulman nylons, Bridge can be dyed using Rit® brand dye to achieve custom color profiles.                   </description>

        <description>                     Use Cleaning Filament to purge the tool head of your LulzBot® 3D printer when going from a high temperature filament to a lower temperature filament, or when transitioning from a dark color filament to a light color filament. Cleaning Filament can also be valuable to purge the tool head after using composite materials. This significantly reduces the likelihood that residual particles might remain in the tool head to affect future prints. Using Cleaning Filament also requires cutting a short length of 100mm -200mm (3.44in - 7.87in) from the coil, and manually controlling the software to transition between the temperature of the last material you printed with and the next material you are going to print with.                   </description>

        <description>                     In addition to it's invigorating fragrance during the printing process, Coffee PLA can have two different finishes: translucent when freshly printed, or opaque when heat-treated!  Anneal (heat-treat) your 3D printed objects in an oven at 60°C(140°) - 110°C(230°F) for less than an hour, or until your printed object takes on an opaque finish. Once heat-treated, your 3D printed part will be stiffer, stronger, and able to withstand warmer environments up to 140°C (285°F). Do not leave printed objects unattended while in an oven.                   </description>

Unlike ABS, HIPS has less potential for warping while printing and is ideal for painting making it popular for use with costumes, models, and miniature figurines. Additionally, the low cost of HIPS makes it an appealing material for rapid prototyping, early testing of modeled objects, and educational settings. HIPS also performs well as a support material. This means it can be used with other filaments when you can print objects with interior cavities, intricate sections, overhanging portions, and much more.                   </description>

        <description>                     HIPS 3D printer filament has similar properties to ABS. Since it is relatively strong it can also be sanded. Unlike ABS, HIPS has less potential for warping while printing and is ideal for painting making it popular for use with costumes, models, and miniature figurines. Additionally, the low cost of HIPS makes it an appealing material for rapid prototyping, early testing of modeled objects, and educational settings. HIPS also performs well as a support material. This means it can be used with other filaments when you can print objects with interior cavities, intricate sections, overhanging portions, and much more.                   </description>

        <description>                     INOVA-1800 prints have a glossy, smooth finish, and feature a great balance of strength and 3D printing ease. 3D prints are dimensionally stable, bridge well and are a great choice for interlocking objects, props, and other functional 3D prints. Unlike other filaments that can require print profile tweaks when switching between colors, INOVA-1800 3D prints the same, across the different color options, due to the consistent level of colorants used during filament production.                      </description>

        <description>                     INOVA-1800 prints have a glossy, smooth finish, and feature a great balance of strength and 3D printing ease. 3D prints are dimensionally stable, bridge well and are a great choice for interlocking objects, props, and other functional 3D prints. Unlike other filaments that can require print profile tweaks when switching between colors, INOVA-1800 3D prints the same, across the different color options, due to the consistent level of colorants used during filament production.                      </description>

        <description>                     This material shows very little warp and does not need to be printed on a heated bed. The extrusion temperature ranges similar to PLA, from 180° C - 200° C with 185° C being the normal extrusion temperature. Hotter temperatures will result in a rougher texture. In general, if you have printed with PLA you should be able to quickly start printing with the Laybrick filament.                   </description>

        <description>                     The material has shown no warping tendencies when printed on a heated bed during testing. Extrusion temperature is fairly wide with a good starting point at 180C. Hotter temperatures will extrude a darker filament; using variable temperatures during a print a faux wood ring pattern can be generated. Finished prints can also be easily sanded, glued and sealed.                   </description>

        <description>                     Objects 3D printed with Magnetic Iron PLA filament can be post-processed to accelerate the iron oxidation process. Printed items may be submerged for 2-3 days for an aged and rusted appearance, or rusted more quickly by applying a special solution made with vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, and salt. See the Links section for directions on how to make this solution. Highlight details by polishing raised surfaces on the 3D printed object. Suggested uses for Magnetic Iron PLA range from sculptures and busts to architectural details and models.                   </description>

PVA filament is mildly flexible at room temperature, making support material removal easier. When 3D printed it leaves no residue on the bottom surface of the part.  Our Natural PVA filament extrudes well through either a standard Greg's Wade style extruder or a Flexystruder, and tends to ooze. It sticks well to painters tape, and less well to PET. We recommend using painters tape and printing with 2-3 layers of raft if you're using PVA as a support material. When used as support material with a Dual Extruder you do not need to use a specific slicing profile. A slicing profile is available that can be used for printing entire models out of our water-soluble PVA filament.                   </description>

        <description>                     This filament's soft elasticity, especially combined with the custom nature of 3D printing, make it ideal for costumes, cell phone cases, covers, grips, and thin sturdy membranes. When using hexagonal infill you can even create objects that are stiffer along one axis orientation, while the other axes remain soft and squishy. Since NinjaFlex is softer and bends more easily, it needs to be printed with the Flexystruder Tool Head. NinjaFlex's high elasticity also requires it to be printed at lower speeds and at a larger layer height than standard filaments. Advanced users can utilize its ability to bind to ABS when using a FlexyDually Tool Head to make prosthetics, live hinges, wearables, and other projects requiring flexible, complex 3D printed items.                    </description>

        <description>                     This filament's soft elasticity, especially combined with the custom nature of 3D printing, make it ideal for costumes, cell phone cases, covers, grips, and thin sturdy membranes. When using hexagonal infill you can even create objects that are stiffer along one axis orientation, while the other axes remain soft and squishy. Since NinjaFlex is softer and bends more easily, it needs to be printed with the Flexystruder Tool Head. NinjaFlex's high elasticity also requires it to be printed at lower speeds and at a larger layer height than standard filaments. Advanced users can utilize its ability to bind to ABS when using a FlexyDually Tool Head to make prosthetics, live hinges, wearables, and other projects requiring flexible, complex 3D printed items.                    </description>

        <description>                     618 nylon is recommended for experienced users. Nylons can be challenging to 3D print due to warping, delamination and bed adherence. Like other Taulman nylons, 618 nylon is glossy white with medium-opacity and can be dyed to achieve custom color profiles using Rit® brand dye.                   </description>

        <description>                     Since objects printed in 645 nylon are so strong and still flexible you can replace existing components. From clasps and buckles, to weight-bearing surfaces and parts subject to friction, nylon 3D printed parts will change the way you look at breakdowns and upgrades on the job. Like other Taulman nylons, 645 nylon is glossy white with medium-opacity and can be dyed to achieve custom color profiles using Rit® brand dye.                   </description>

        <description>                     Since SemiFlex is harder than other flexible filaments, complex parts like device cases with overhangs, holes, and details are easier to print while still maintaining its flexible nature. SemiFlex also has applications in robotics due to its ability to function as a tread or grip. SemiFlex is more flexible than standard filaments, so the Flexystruder Tool Head is required when printing with it. SemiFlex prints cleanly and more quickly than other flexible filaments, like NinjaFlex. Advanced users can utilize its ability to bind to ABS when using a FlexyDually Tool Head to make prosthetics, live hinges, wearables, and other projects requiring flexible, complex 3D printed items.                   </description>

        <description>                     Since SemiFlex is harder than other flexible filaments, complex parts like device cases with overhangs, holes, and details are easier to print while still maintaining its flexible nature. SemiFlex also has applications in robotics due to its ability to function as a tread or grip. SemiFlex is more flexible than standard filaments, so the Flexystruder Tool Head is required when printing with it. SemiFlex prints cleanly and more quickly than other flexible filaments, like NinjaFlex. Advanced users can utilize its ability to bind to ABS when using a FlexyDually Tool Head to make prosthetics, live hinges, wearables, and other projects requiring flexible, complex 3D printed items.                   </description>

        <description>                     Stainless Steel PLA is 93% more dense than common 3D printing PLA filament, so 3D printed objects will have a surprising weight to them. You can also make your printed objects look like cast metal through polishing. Post-print processing with successively finer grits of sandpaper and finishing with a cloth wheel minimizes any visible layers while showing off the shiny, metallic finish. Stainless Steel PLA works well for models and figurines, costumes, jewelry, and props.                   </description>

Printed objects can be sanded after printing for a smoother surface finish. Experiment with wood filler and wood stain on your woodFill prints as an advanced post-processing technique.                   </description>
