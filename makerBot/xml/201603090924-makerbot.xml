PLA Filament is the best and most consistent filament designed for the MakerBot Replicator 2 Desktop 3D Printer and all Fifth Generation MakerBot Replicator 3D Printers.When used with MakerBot Replicator 3D Printers, PLA Filament helps produce higher-quality prints, reduce filament problems, and minimize downtime.Compared to ABS, PLA demonstrates much less part warping and curling and, for this reason, can be successfully printed without a heated build plate.Details such as sharp corners and edges print well and PLA printed objects will generally have a glossier look and feel.MakerBot PLA Filament is a nontoxic resin made of sugar derived from field corn and has a semisweet smell (like waffles) when heated.If you’re new to 3D printing, MakerBot PLA Filament is a good material to start with because it’s easy to use and performs well on most prints.Every MakerBot PLA Filament color also undergoes long-duration testing using a large 3D model that requires 18–24 hours of print time, to ensure that there are no deviations in print quality.MakerBot PLA Filament adheres well to acrylic and to MakerBot Build Plate Tape.Every MakerBot PLA Filament color is comprehensively quality tested at both high (100 micron) and medium (200 micron) layer resolutions on all MakerBot Replicator 3D Printers to verify that the filament will perform every feature that MakerBot apps offer and will reliably slice and print all types of models.</description><seller>makerbot</seller><sellerWeb>makerbot.com</sellerWeb></product><product

Replicator 3D Printers, PLA Filament helps produce higher-quality prints, reduce filament problems, and minimize downtime.Compared to ABS, PLA demonstrates much less part warping and curling and, for this reason, can be successfully printed without a heated build plate.Details such as sharp corners and edges print well and PLA printed objects will generally have a glossier look and feel.MakerBot PLA Filament is a nontoxic resin made of sugar derived from field corn and has a semisweet smell (like waffles) when heated.If you’re new to 3D printing, MakerBot PLA Filament is a good material to start with because it’s easy to use and performs well on most prints.Every MakerBot PLA Filament color also undergoes long-duration testing using a large 3D model that requires 18–24 hours of print time, to ensure that there are no deviations in print quality.MakerBot PLA Filament adheres well to acrylic and to MakerBot Build Plate Tape.Every MakerBot PLA Filament color is comprehensively

start with because it’s easy to use and performs well on most prints.Every MakerBot PLA Filament color also undergoes long-duration testing using a large 3D model that requires 18–24 hours of print time, to ensure that there are no deviations in print quality.MakerBot PLA Filament adheres well to acrylic and to MakerBot Build Plate Tape.Every MakerBot PLA Filament color is comprehensively quality tested at both high (100 micron) and medium (200 micron) layer resolutions on all MakerBot Replicator 3D Printers to verify that the filament will perform every feature that MakerBot apps

PLA Filament is the best and most consistent filament designed for the MakerBot Replicator 2 Desktop 3D Printer and all Fifth Generation MakerBot Replicator 3D Printers.When used with MakerBot Replicator 3D Printers, PLA Filament helps produce higher-quality prints, reduce filament problems, and minimize downtime.Compared to ABS, PLA demonstrates much less part warping and curling and, for this reason, can be successfully printed without a heated build plate.Details such as sharp corners and edges print well and PLA printed objects will generally have a glossier look and feel.MakerBot PLA Filament is a nontoxic resin made of sugar derived from field corn and has a semisweet smell (like waffles) when heated.If you’re new to 3D printing, MakerBot PLA Filament is a good material to start with because it’s easy to use and performs well on most prints.Every MakerBot PLA Filament color also undergoes long-duration testing using a large 3D model that requires 18–24 hours of print time, to ensure that there are no deviations in print quality.MakerBot PLA Filament adheres well to acrylic and to MakerBot Build Plate Tape.Every MakerBot PLA Filament color is comprehensively quality tested at both high (100 micron) and medium (200 micron) layer resolutions on all MakerBot Replicator 3D Printers to verify that the filament will perform every feature that MakerBot apps offer and will reliably slice and print all types of models.</description><seller>makerbot</seller><sellerWeb>makerbot.com</sellerWeb></product><product

             MakerBot ABS Filament helps produce higher-quality prints,&#13;
              reduce filament problems, and minimize downtime.All MakerBot Filament is manufactured to produce the highest quality 3D prints and is trusted by leading companies and institutions the world over, thanks to state-of-the-art filament manufacturing and quality control standards.&#13;
&#13;
Because it’s more flexible than PLA, MakerBot ABS is great for mechanical designs or ones that have interlocking or pin-connected pieces.Compared to PLA, ABS has a longer lifespan, is more impact resistant, and has a more matte look and finish.&#13;
&#13;
MakerBot ABS Filament has a high melting point, so it’s suitable for machine or car parts.&#13;
&#13;
MakerBot ABS Filament is soluble in acetone, so you can “weld” parts together with just a drop or two or smooth surfaces and create a high gloss by brushing or dipping full ABS pieces in acetone.MakerBot ABS filament adheres well to Kapton tape on a heated build plate.&#13;
&#13;
                 MakerBot ABS Filament requires a heated build platform. Also, make sure your build plate is level, clean, and oil-free.&#13;
&#13;
                 Use MakerBot ABS Filament in a well-ventilated area.</description><seller>makerbot</seller><sellerWeb>makerbot.com</sellerWeb></product><product id="75"><materialType>abs</materialType><matherialSubType>abs</matherialSubType><brand>makerbot</brand><producer>makerbot</producer><ingredient/><price>48</price><priceUnit>USD</priceUnit><diameter>1.75</diameter><diameterUnit>mm</diameterUnit><color>True Orange</color><colorImgUrl>http://store.makerbot.com/mb-images/store/filament/abs/trueorange.jpg</colorImgUrl><weight>1</weight><weightUnit>kg</weightUnit><packForm/><weightInKg>1</weightInKg><imageUrl>http://store.makerbot.com/mb-images/store/filament/abs/Spool_ABS.jpg</imageUrl><url>http://store.makerbot.com/filament/abs</url><description>MakerBot ABS Filament is the best,             most consistent, and most tested&#13;

             MakerBot ABS Filament helps produce higher-quality prints,&#13;
              reduce filament problems, and minimize downtime.All MakerBot Filament is manufactured to produce the highest quality 3D prints and is trusted by leading companies and institutions the world over, thanks to state-of-the-art filament manufacturing and quality control standards.&#13;
&#13;
Because it’s more flexible than PLA, MakerBot ABS is great for mechanical designs or ones that have interlocking or pin-connected pieces.Compared to PLA, ABS has a longer lifespan, is more impact resistant, and has a more matte look and finish.&#13;
&#13;
MakerBot ABS Filament has a high melting point, so it’s suitable for machine or car parts.&#13;
&#13;
MakerBot ABS Filament is soluble in acetone, so you can “weld” parts together with just a drop or two or smooth surfaces and create a high gloss by brushing or dipping full ABS pieces in acetone.MakerBot ABS filament adheres well to Kapton tape on a heated build plate.&#13;
&#13;
                 MakerBot ABS Filament requires a heated build platform. Also, make sure your build plate is level, clean, and oil-free.&#13;

&#13;
             Limonene is a nontoxic solvent made from orange rinds. It’s a common, colorless, citrus-  scented solvent available online and in grocery and home stores.Unleash your creativity! Create 3D prints with complexity, overhangs, and movable parts  never before possible.&#13;
&#13;
              Place the 3D print in limonene and the supports will dissolve away in just 8–24 hours, leaving the print made with ABS Filament intact.MakerBot Dissolvable Filament is optimized for MakerBot Replicator 2X Experimental 3D Printers and specifically designed for use as a solid infill material with MakerBot ABS Filament.&#13;
&#13;
             MakerBot Dissolvable Filament is fully supported by the free and powerful MakerBot Desktop app that automatically generates the needed support structure.</description><seller>makerbot</seller><sellerWeb>makerbot.com</sellerWeb></product></ProductInfo>
